  <title>Tarantool: an overview</title>
  <para>   
    <productname>Tarantool</productname> is a scalable software platform integrated with a database management system.
    It handles Lua functions asynchronously which makes it appropriate for real-time applications.
    It has a "fiber" model which means that many applications can run simultaneously on a single
    thread, while the Tarantool server can run multiple threads for input-output and background maintenance.
    It integrates the LuaJIT -- "Just In Time" -- Lua compiler, Lua libraries for most common
    applications, socket support, and the Tarantool Database Server which is an established
    NoSQL DBMS. Thus it serves all the purposes that have made node.js and Twisted popular in
    other environments, with the additional twist that it has a data persistence level.

    The code is free. The open-source license is  <citetitle

  <para>
    Tarantool's creator and biggest user is <citetitle xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail.ru">Mail.Ru</citetitle>,
    the largest internet company in Russia, with 30 million users, 25 million emails per day,
    and a web site whose Alexa global rank is in the <link xlink:href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/mail.ru">top 40</link> worldwide.
    Tarantool services Mail.Ru's hottest data, such as the session data of online users,
    the properties of online applications, the caches of the underlying data,
    the distribution and sharding algorithms, and much more.
    Outside Mail.Ru the software is used by a growing
    number of projects in online gaming, digital marketing, and social
    media industries. While product development is sponsored by Mail.Ru, the
    roadmap, the bugs database and the development process are fully
    open. The software incorporates patches from dozens of
    community contributors. The Tarantool community writes and maintains
    most of the drivers for programming languages.
    The greater Lua community has hundreds of useful packages
    which can become Tarantool extensions.
  </para>

  <para>
    Users can create, modify and drop <emphasis
    role="strong">Lua functions</emphasis> at runtime.
     Or they can define <emphasis role="strong">Lua programs</emphasis>
    that are loaded during startup for triggers, background tasks,
    and interacting with networked peers.
    Unlike popular application development frameworks based on
    a "reactor" pattern, networking in server-side Lua is
    sequential, yet very efficient, as it is built on top of the
    <emphasis role="strong">cooperative multitasking</emphasis>
    environment that Tarantool itself uses.
    A key feature is that the functions
    can access and modify databases atomically.
    Thus some developers look at it as "a DBMS with a popular stored procedure language",
    while others look at it as a replacement for multiple components
    of "multi-tier Web application architectures".
    Performance is a few thousand transactions per second
    on a laptop, scalable upwards or outwards to server farms.
  </para>
  
  <para>
    <emphasis role="strong">Tarantool is lock-free</emphasis>.
    Instead of the operating system's concurrency primitives, such
    as mutexes, Tarantool uses cooperative
    multitasking to handle thousands of connections simultaneously.
    There is a fixed number of independent execution threads.
    The threads do not share state. Instead they
    exchange data using low-overhead message queues. While this
    approach limits the number of cores that the server will use,
    it removes competition for the memory bus and ensures peak
    scalability of memory access and network throughput.
    CPU utilization of a typical highly-loaded
    Tarantool server is under 10%.
  </para>

  <para>
    Although Tarantool can run without it, the database management component is a
    strong distinguishing feature. So here is a closer look at "The Box",
    or DBMS server.
  </para>

  <para>
    Ordinarily the server <emphasis role="strong">keeps all the data in
    random-access memory</emphasis>, and therefore has very low read
    latency. (There is also a conventional disk-based storage engine
    named Sophia but we will defer discussion of it to a later section.)
    The server <emphasis role="strong">keeps persistent copies of
    the data in non-volatile storage</emphasis>, such as disk,
    when users request "snapshots". The server <emphasis role="strong">
    maintains a write-ahead log (WAL)</emphasis> to ensure
    consistency and crash safety of the persistent copies.
    The server <emphasis role="strong">performs inserts and updates atomically</emphasis> --
    changes are not considered complete until the WAL is written.
    The logging subsystem supports group commit.
  </para>

  <para>
    When the rate of data changes is high, the write-ahead log file
    (or files) can grow quickly. This uses up disk space, and
    increases the time necessary to restart the server (because
    the server must start with the last snapshot, and then replay
    the transactions that are in the log). The solution is to
    make snapshots frequently. Therefore the server ensures that
    <emphasis role="strong">snapshots are quick, resource-savvy, and non-blocking
    </emphasis>. To accomplish this, the server uses delayed garbage
    collection for data pages and uses a copy-on-write technique for
    index pages. This ensures that the snapshot process has a
    consistent read view.
  </para>

  <para>
    Unlike most NoSQL DBMSs, Tarantool supports <emphasis role="strong">
    secondary index keys and multi-part index keys</emphasis>
    as well as primary keys. The possible index types are
    HASH, TREE, and BITSET.
  </para>

  <para>
    Tarantool supports
    <emphasis role="strong">asynchronous replication</emphasis>,
    locally or to a remote host. Replication does not
    cause blocking of writes to the master database.
    If the master becomes unavailable, a replica can assume the
    master role without requiring a restart.
    In this latest version the replication architecture can be
    <emphasis role="strong">master-master</emphasis>, that is,
    many nodes may both handle the loads and receive what others
    have handled, for the same data sets.
